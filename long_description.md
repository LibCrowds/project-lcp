These index cards provide an access point to the Lord Chamberlain’s Plays and
Correspondence. We are transcribing these cards to add the information to our
electronic catalogue IAMS. These transcriptions will help us enhance our
catalogue. The information on these cards can vary, please make sure you
record all the information on the card. But don’t worry if there isn’t
information for all the fields present on the card. There will always be at
least a play title. Transcribe it in natural language, putting any articles at
the front. You can find more detailed guidance on the [tutorial page](./tutorial).
